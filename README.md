<h1>PM User Creator</h1>
<bold>Simple program that creates users in Windows.</bold>

This program is part of my school project, main goal of this is to create program that is able to mass manage users in Windows.
Usecase of this program is creation of users on RDP servers, for example : admin creates 100 users using this program and then assigns
every user his own number so he will login with name UserXXX then he chooses his new password and starts to using his Remote Desktop.
